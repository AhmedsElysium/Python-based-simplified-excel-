# Python-based-simplified-excel-
Simplified excel for multipurpose basic data entry and analysis

This was made for a fundamental computer science course. It has a minimalist structure which allows even the most technically illiterate person to grasp the user interface. 

The user is prompted with the options to import an existing csv or to create one. The user may modify the csv or create a new csv file which contains statistics with regards to some chosen parameters.

This project can easily be integrated with more advanced functionality but for the sake of the targeted consumer it was decided to be redundant.
